Overview of the Project
===========

This project is designed to improve efficiency and focus in call centers by using AI to monitor worker behavior. It detects if workers are wearing headsets, if they are drowsy, or if they are using a phone during work hours. Additionally, it uses a face calibration system to identify workers uniquely, ensuring accurate tracking. An alert system is implemented to notify supervisors when specific conditions persist for a set period, such as prolonged drowsiness, absence of a headset, or phone usage.
